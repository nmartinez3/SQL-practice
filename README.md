# SQL-practice
Just practicing some SQL!!! 

Working on learning about creating tables (including dummy/simulated data tables to learn from and practice on), working with indexes and different types of indexes for different types of queries, and also working on triggers for update, insert, and delete statements, eventually in conjunction with maintaining indexes as well.
